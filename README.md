# Project Description :  

Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure which is used to store key. Main advantage of using Trie is that the search complexities can be brought to optimal limit i.e. the key length. It is usually very fast in compare to naive search where we check for every word in our collections that it matches with key.

Consider a situation where a user is typing and in mid way all suggestion (words which user actually wants to type) just pops up. 
This feature can be implemented with the help of trie. We store all the words which are most often used or which are most often typed by a user in the past. Now whenever user types a prefix, our algorithm will find all suggestions (or words) which user actually want to type. 

All utility function (like searching ,inserting , deletion , autoComplete ) are implemented in C++.
