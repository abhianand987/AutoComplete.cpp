# AutoComplete.cpp
# Project Description :  As we all know that Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure which is used to store key . Main advantage of trie is searching a key i.e. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length) which is very fast in compare to naive search where we check for every word in our collections that it matches with key.  Consider a situation where a user is typing and in mid way all suggestion( words which user actually wants to type ) just pops up . This feature can be implements with the help of trie. We can store all the words which are most often used or which are most often typed by user in past . Now whenever user types a prefix , our algorithm will find all suggestions ( or words ) which user actually want to type. All utility function (like searching ,inserting , deletion , autoComplete ) are implemented in C++.
